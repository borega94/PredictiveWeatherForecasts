Project: Predictive Weather Forecasts
Name: Alexandra, Carsten, Chris, Judith, Philipp
Description: Renewable energies make up an ever increasing part of the electricity supply and more and more private households are deciding to install their own solar systems. Unfortunately, these are regularly damaged by extreme weather conditions such as hail, which leads to high replacement costs and also isn't very sustainable. We have therefore been looking for a solution to prevent such damage and came up with the idea of using machine learning to predict days with a high probability of hail. With this information solar panel owners could be warned in time and cover up their systems.
